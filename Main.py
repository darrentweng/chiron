    \nWe were inspired by a lifelong love of trivia and game-based learning platforms such as Kahoot and Quizlet. 
    At home, we have always loved learning new information and developing new thinking skills and at school, we 
    enjoyed participating in class games such as Kahoot and utilized services such as Quizlets to study for quizzes and tests.''')

    \nThis project has two main functions: a trivia app, and a chatbot. Students and/or their teachers/tutors can 
    upload questions and answers to the website and then practice those questions and answers on the website in a 
    trivia format. The website counts how many right or wrong answers the user inputs so that they can know how 
    they are doing. The chatbot interacts with the user to gauge their mood and helps to tailor a learning experience 
    to each student.''')
